## Introduction
Calcium imaging is inherently susceptible to detection noise especially when imaging with high frame rate or under low excitation dosage. However, calcium transients are highly dynamic, non-repetitive activities and a firing pattern cannot be captured twice. Clean images for supervised training of deep neural networks are not accessible. Here, we present DeepCAD, a deep self-supervised learning-based method for calcium imaging denoising. Using our method, detection noise can be effectively removed and the accuracy of neuron extraction and spike inference can be highly improved.
