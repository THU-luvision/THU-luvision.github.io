<b><font size=5>Introduction</font></b> ![github](/pic/icon.png){: float=right; width="30px" }

We perform multidisciplinary research in the emerging field of Computational Imaging and Visual Intelligence. To transcend the boundaries of visual computing technology, we focus on hardware-software co-designed imaging and opto-electronic co-optimized computing. Our projects relate to Gigapixel Videography, Light field Imaging, Large-scale Reconstruction, All-optical Computing, etc., towards both the smart imaging systems and intelligent algorithmic solutions.
