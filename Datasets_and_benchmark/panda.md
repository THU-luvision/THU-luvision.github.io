## Introduction
**PANDA** is the first gigaPixel-level humAN-centric viDeo dAtaset, for large-scale, long-term, and multi-object visual analysis. The videos in PANDA were captured by a gigapixel camera and cover real-world large-scale scenes with both wide field-of-view (~1km^2 area) and high resolution details (gigapixel-level/frame). The scenes may contain 4k head counts with over 100Ã— scale variation. PANDA provides enriched and hierarchical ground-truth annotations, including 15,974.6k bounding boxes, 111.8k fine-grained attribute labels, 12.7k trajectories, 2.2k groups and 2.9k interactions. <br/><br/>Please visit the following website for more details: [http://www.panda-dataset.com/](http://www.panda-dataset.com/)
